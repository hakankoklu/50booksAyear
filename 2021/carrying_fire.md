## Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys

##### by Michael Collins

* My father’s younger brother, J. Lawton Collins, was Army Chief of Staff at the time; my father had retired as a two-star general; another uncle had been a brigadier; my brother was a colonel; my cousin a major

* It was a brutal process as well. In the eleven weeks I was there, twenty-two people were killed. In retrospect it seems preposterous to endure such casualty rates without help from the enemy, but at the time the risk appeared perfectly acceptable. 

* How had I managed to take so long to get so little done—no advanced degree, a piddling two thousand hours’ flying time, thirty years old, and nothing special in my record to offset these deficiencies?

* ... the astronauts were hired early enough to participate in the design phases of Gemini and Apollo, and in my view this was one of the wisest decisions NASA made.

* ... they were here to fly, not to be locked up in a can and shot around the world like ammunition. In Project Mercury, on the other hand, one rode; granted there had been only one Mercury flight so far, Al Shepard’s fifteen-minute up-and-downer, but he was a passenger, man, a talking monkey.
At Edwards the old heads clucked with disapproval: Why all the fuss? Not one quarter of the skill, finesse, or flying technique of an X-l5 flight was required here, yet the public went wild. Life magazine showered them with money to tell their “personal stories” to the eager nation; but had X-l5 pilot Bob White been offered a similar deal, the Air Force would have summarily turned it down.

* This year I want to fly to the moon, badly I want it, and I will describe that white card in any way that will please them. Perhaps I see a great white moon in it, or a picture of Mother and Dad, with Dad a little larger than Mother. Second-guessing the shrinks is not easy.

* I had come a long way from Casa Blanca, but not because of any remarkable foresight on my part. I had had no master plan. The choices had simply been there and I had taken them, one step at a time. A free education at West Point or an expensive civilian one? Army career or Air Force? Pilot or ground officer? Fighters or transports? Test pilot training or more of the same? Fighter Ops or Wright-Patterson? Edwards or Houston? With one part shrewd logic and nine parts blind luck, I had qualified for Houston, and was now off to a different life, perhaps even to the moon.

* ... in the meantime things on the ground weren’t half bad either, with a “personal story” contract with Life magazine and Field Enterprises. This contract, which brought us $16,000 a year 

* Pat felt that to take money under any circumstances for our participation in the space program was wrong, since the taxpayers had financed it and we should not gain personally from a public venture. On the other hand, I felt strongly that the contract was legitimate and that we were entitled to it. The argument was a complex one, and continues to this day, at least in certain elements of the press and astronaut worlds.

* The truth of the matter is that the space program would be precisely where it is today had medical participation in it been zero, or perhaps it would be even a little bit ahead, because we could have done without all the impediments and medical claptrap, such as blood-pressure cuffs, exercise ergometers, and urine-output measuring devices. All they did was add weight, and complexity, and rob time and energy from tasks of greater value.

* I also had plenty of time to contemplate the rapid pace at which I was speeding toward the moon. From supersonic jets at Edwards, I had progressed all the way to kicking a burro up out of the Grand Canyon. 

* If we want to change course, it’s as simple as ABC. We just get Roger Chaffee’s tracking network to send up a state vector and a couple of other things to Dave Scott’s computer, which feeds pointing commands through Dick Gordon’s instrument panel to Donn Eisele’s controls, which cause Walt Cunningham’s electricity to power Gene Cernan’s engines, which fire, to get us out of Bill Anders’s radiation zone into the position called for by Buzz Aldrin’s flight plan. The rest of you guys must be loafing!

* ... there is a kind of love-hate relationship between an astronaut and his pressure suit. Love because it is an intimate garment protecting him twenty-four hours a day, hate because it can be extremely uncomfortable and cumbersome. Generally, as time goes by, the emphasis shifts from hate to love, so that by flight day the astronaut has a garment which he regards as an old friend, one which has been meticulously tailored to his every dimension, one which has been worn long enough to be comfortable, but not long enough to suffer undue wear and tear. 

* Such logic, or lack of it, is prevalent at launch time. All the months of calm dispassionate analysis give way to a few minutes of emotion, an outburst of hope and horror as the inert beast comes alive for the first time, shakes itself and its new-found tail of fire, and starts slowly—so slowly—to move. For the first few seconds it is purely a spectacle, for with the eyes alone involved, one can see but not succumb. But when the great crackling Mach 1 roar arrives, and the very ground under you shakes, then you are there, you are part of it, and you laugh or cry or yell or whisper. 

* ... and besides I would have flown by myself or with a kangaroo—I just wanted to fly. All that stuff about crew psychological compatibility is crap. Almost anyone can put up with almost anyone else for a clearly defined period of time in pursuit of a mutual objective important to each.

* I think our selection board breathed a sigh of relief that there were no women, because women made problems, no doubt about it. It was bad enough to have to unzip your pressure suit, stick a plastic bag on your bottom, and defecate—with ugly old John Young sitting six inches away. How about if it was a woman? Besides, penisless, she couldn’t even use a CUVMS, so that system would have to be completely redesigned. No, it was better to stick with men.

* Here I am, just a fancy heavy-equipment operator who couldn’t fix any piece of this machine if it broke. Even my wife is a better mechanic than I.

* I have actually space-walked from one satellite to another and retrieved a package from it! I can’t get it out of my mind. Too bad it got cut short, too bad I didn’t have a chance to savor the experience, to let the view soak in a bit. Funny there was no sensation of motion, or of falling, especially considering that I get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach when I peer over the edge of the roof of a tall building. I really wasn’t very conscious of the earth at all, only the Agena and the spacecraft—one at a time, depending on what had to be done next. Work, work, work! A guy should be told to go out on the end of his string and simply gaze around—what guru gets to meditate for a whole earth’s worth? 

* The NASA engineers assigned to Apollo were not particularly helpful, either. Gemini had always been billed as a testing ground for Apollo, a means of gaining practical experience that could be applied to the lunar effort. But strangely enough, when Gemini methods were suggested to the Apollo engineers, there was no eagerness to accept or even to listen. At the first mention of the word Gemini, a veil came down, the eyes became slightly glassy, and one was informed—generally in a cool and faintly supercilious tone—that it was simply not done that way on Apollo. To disagree was simply to admit that one had not yet mastered the superior intricacies of the Apollo system.

* Even a frog was to be carried on board, not a leaping frog, but one whose inner ear was wired and who was encased in a miniature centrifuge. After enjoying weightlessness for prescribed intervals, the frog was to be periodically spun up on the centrifuge, and his otolith function duly recorded. The crew couldn’t even warn the poor suffering little bastard, but merely flipped a FROG switch to ON, and away he went. Imagine that, a FROG ON-OFF switch, hardly work for test pilots.

* it irked me more than a little to read various articles to the effect that NASA had finally been able to solve the problems which had exhausted all the previous space walkers. Ed White hadn’t had any problems, and neither had I, except for the obvious fact that the Agena had never been designed to be space-walked upon. Certainly Buzz’s tinkering with a board full of restraining devices was child’s play compared to removing an experiment package from a second (inert and unprepared) satellite. I was also puzzled that Gemini 12 had been given a fourth day to complete its assigned tasks, although its list of experiments was no longer than Gemini 10’s. Oh, how John and I could have used a fourth day!

* I have answered a thousand times the question “How did you and Armstrong and Aldrin decide who was going to stay in the command module and who was going to walk on the moon?” I have answered it a hundred ways, none of them completely honest, but then it’s so hard to say, “Listen, lady, when they canceled 014 I lost my chance,” even if that is 99 percent of it. From late 1966 on, I became a command module specialist, and though I changed crews, I never changed specialties again.

* ... everywhere one looked, people were struggling to catch up. I don’t think the fire delayed the first lunar landing one day, because it took until mid-1969 to get all the problems solved in areas completely unrelated to the fire.

* Although Buzz never came out and said it in so many words, I think his basic beef was that Neil was going to be the first to set foot on the moon. Originally, some of the early check lists were written to show a co-pilot first exit, but Neil ignored these and exercised his commander’s prerogative to crawl out first. This had been decided in April, and Buzz’s attitude took a noticeable turn in the direction of gloom and introspection shortly thereafter. Once he tentatively approached me about the injustice of the situation, but I quickly turned him off. I had enough problems without getting into the middle of that one.

* His main message—and a good one, I think—was that we were not to take any undue risks. If things didn’t look right, we were to come on home, and he would see to it that we would get the next flight for another try at it. This removed the obvious risk of our letting our desire to be first on the moon cloud our judgment in analyzing hazards that might crop up along the way.

* I know that I would be a liar or a fool if I said that I have the best of the three Apollo 11 seats, but I can say with truth and equanimity that I am perfectly satisfied with the one I have. This venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two.

* Apollo 11 was perceived by most Americans as being an end, rather than a beginning

* It’s simply the American way, to view a televised spectacular and think of it as the Super Bowl. Then followed confusion and a trace of irritation. Why was the Super Bowl being played over and over again? When Apollo 13 blew its oxygen tanks and the networks interrupted their regular programs to report it, they received angry phone calls for their efforts. By Apollo 16, The Washington Post’s inimitable Nicholas von Hoffman headlined it TWO KLUTZES ON THE MOON

* I think is worth examining is the American tendency to be faddish, supporting “in” things blindly and just as blindly rejecting the passé. This line of thought tends to force evaluation on an either/or basis. Either cure cancer or fly in space. Either clean up the environment or fly in space. There doesn’t seem to be a willingness to do all these things on a balanced basis. 

* ... my favorite story goes back to 1783, when Ben Franklin witnessed the first public launching, in Paris, of a hydrogen balloon. Of what possible use was this new invention, a skeptic asked Franklin, and he replied, “Of what use is a newborn babe?”

* I want to walk over the recently constructed bridge connecting Europe and Asia, but I don’t think I will. I think having it to walk over is better than having walked over it.
