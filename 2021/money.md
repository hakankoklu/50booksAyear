## Money

##### The True Story of a Made-up Thing

##### by Jacob Goldstein

* Native American people spent days hanging out, making speeches, dancing, and giving stuff to each other. Gift giving was a power move, like insisting on paying the check at a restaurant. Before the Europeans arrived, high-status people gave furs and canoes. By the twentieth century, they were giving sewing machines and motorcycles. This wanton generosity freaked out the Canadians so much that the government made the practice illegal. People went to prison for giving stuff to each other.

* The first writers weren’t poets; they were accountants. For a long time, that’s all writing was. No love notes. No eulogies. No stories. Just IOU six sheep.

* The more some central authority decides who makes what and who gets what, the less a society needs money. In the Americas, thousands of years after the Mesopotamians, the Incas would create a giant, complex civilization without any money at all.

* The Incas had rivers full of gold and mountains full of silver, and they used gold and silver for art and for worship. But they never invented money because it was a fiction they had no use for.

* In some, including Athens, the polis evolved into democracy (though, by our standards, it was a crappy democracy that excluded women, slaves, and most immigrants).

* The agora also continued to be a place for public discussion, but in the long run shopping won out over public discourse. In modern Greek, the word agora is a noun that means market, and a verb that means to buy.

* Around 995 AD, a merchant in Sichuan’s capital, Chengdu, had an idea. He started letting people leave their iron coins with him. In exchange for coins, he would give people fancy, standardized paper receipts.

* The warning wasn’t entirely successful: The earliest surviving printing plates for paper money are counterfeits. But despite the forgeries, paper money was a hit.

* Markets and money made cities. At a time when fewer than 100,000 people lived in London and Paris, two Chinese cities grew to more than a million people each.

* By 1200, China was quite possibly the richest and certainly the most technologically advanced civilization in the world. Then the Mongols rode in.

* The vast reach of the Mongol empire was great for trade. Now the market for Chinese goods extended not just throughout China, but across Asia and beyond.

* Kublai Khan resisted for a while, but eventually the temptation was too strong to bear. After all, Japan was sitting right there, across a little sea, just begging to be invaded. Why not print up a little more paper so we can pay people to build ships to sail 70,000 soldiers and horses over there to show them who’s universal sovereign?

* This is the radical experiment that Marco Polo witnessed: money as almost pure abstraction, backed by nothing. It would be like if Wile E. Coyote ran off the cliff, looked down, saw empty space below him—and didn’t fall. Partly this is a testament to the sheer power of the Mongol state: use this paper as money or I’ll kill you. But partly, after three hundred years of using paper money, people in China had figured out that paper money worked not because it was backed by silver or bronze, but because everybody agreed paper could be money.

* By the mid-1400s, paper money had disappeared from China entirely.

* The emperor had succeeded in dragging China back to the past. The average person in China was poorer than her ancestors had been two hundred years earlier. The economic revolution that happened when paper money was invented was largely forgotten.

* But one thing China’s three-hundred-year-blip tells us is this: economic growth and technological change aren’t guaranteed to continue forever. Development is not a one-way street. Civilizations don’t just get richer or stay the same. Sometimes they become poorer, generation after generation. Sometimes money itself disappears.

* Banks today do what the British goldsmiths did almost four hundred years ago: when you deposit money, the bank turns around and lends some of it out to someone else. That money—your money—is now in two places at once. It is your money, in your account at the bank. It is also the borrower’s money. The borrower can deposit her money at another bank, which can then lend some of it out to yet another borrower. The same dollar is now in three places at once. This is called fractional-reserve banking, and it’s how the vast majority of money in the world is created.

* The money changers sat on benches on a busy bridge over the Grand Canal, so they were called banchieri, which translates as “bench-sitters,” and which is the root of our words banker and bank.

* The thing that makes money money is trust—when we trust that we will be able to buy stuff with this piece of paper, or this lump of metal, tomorrow, and next month, and next year.

* “The essence of finance is time travel,” the banker-turned-writer Matt Levine wrote. “Saving is about moving resources from the present into the future; financing is about moving resources from the future back into the present.”

* Almost as soon as people started trading stocks, they also started coming up with complex variations that allowed for new kinds of bets. One kind of bet in particular emerged almost immediately: a short, which allows an investor to profit when the price of the stock goes down. People in Amsterdam hated shorts, as people around the world have continued to hate them ever since.

* A pretty good working definition of money is: it’s the thing you pay taxes with. In a world where different things are competing to be money the thing the government accepts for taxes is going to win. It’s going to become money.

* Economists have this odd phrase: “the real economy.” It means, roughly, all economic activity that happens outside of finance. When an economy is working well, the real economy and finance support each other. But there are times when the real economy and finance become disconnected. Sometimes, finance lags behind the real economy. There’s not enough money, or loans, to go around, and nobody wants to invest in anything. At other times, finance races out ahead of the real economy. There’s too much money floating around, it’s too easy to get a loan, and everybody wants to invest. People start buying not because they want a future stream of income from their investments, but because they speculate they can turn around and sell for more in a day or a month.

* For modern money to work—to have banks, and a stock market, and a central bank—there needs to be tension. Investors and bankers and activists and government officials all need to be arguing over who gets to do what, and when.

* “The founding of a national bank would be fatal in an absolute monarchy,” Saint-Simon said just before Law founded his bank, “whereas in a free country it might be a wise and profitable undertaking.”

* someone flipped the switch at a new power plant and suddenly lightbulbs in homes and offices scattered around lower Manhattan glowed. It was like magic. But Edison wasn’t at the power plant to flip the switch. He was a few blocks away, literally on Wall Street, hanging out with J. P. Morgan and a bunch of other bankers to witness this momentous occasion. It was money, as much as anything, that made the lights go on.

* We celebrate people who create jobs, but in the long run, we get richer by destroying jobs—by figuring out how to do the same amount of work with fewer people.

* Here is a thing that always happens with money: whatever money is at a given moment comes to seem like the natural form money should take, and anything else seems like irresponsible craziness.

* Of course banks are greedy! Of course corporations are selfish, and Wall Street is wily! Blaming a financial crisis on these qualities is like blaming a flood on the wetness of water. A twenty-first-century economist pointed out that if Wall Street greed caused financial crises, we’d have a crisis every week. The important question at the time—and, indeed, the question we should always be asking—is: How can we design a monetary system that channels that greed and selfishness and wile toward socially useful ends, and limits the potential harm inherent in finance?

* At the core of the gold standard was a simple rule: anyone who wanted to could walk into a Federal Reserve Bank and trade paper dollars for gold—one ounce for every $20.67.

* “After all,” he said, “there is an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than currency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the people".

* Roosevelt understood that money is money because we believe it’s money. Roosevelt, like John Law before him, made it a crime for people simply to own gold. Roosevelt’s approach to money was ad hoc, ill informed, and contrary to what most smart, well-meaning, well-informed people thought he should do. Also, it worked. Not beautifully, not perfectly. But it definitely worked. Roosevelt recognized that there was nothing natural about the gold standard; it was as artificial as any other monetary arrangement. The gold standard was a choice people had made—even if they didn’t recognize it as a choice. Roosevelt’s great genius was simply to say: we can choose something else.

* In the twenty-first century, it has become wildly clear that one of the most important things central bankers do is make promises that people believe. By promising to save the euro, Draghi saved the euro. That’s the magic trick! Money is trust; in the modern world, where central banks have the ultimate power over money, money is trust in central bankers.

* The history of money is largely the history of stuff becoming money without people really realizing it.

* The history of electronic money is exactly the opposite. Someone—David Chaum, Satoshi Nakamoto—has a very clever technological breakthrough. Then they climb up to the mountaintop and proclaim to the world: “Here is a new kind of money!” And then it doesn’t really become money. Or at least it hasn’t yet.
