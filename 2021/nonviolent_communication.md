## Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life

##### Life-Changing Tools for Healthy Relationships

##### by Marshall B. Rosenberg

### Chapter 1: Giving from the Heart

* NVC: a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart. The way we talk to be "violent", words often lead to hurt and pain, whether for others or ourselves.

* NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and hear others. Instead of habitual, automatic reactions, our words become conscious responses based firmly on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting. We are led to express ourselves with honesty and clarity, while simultaneously paying others a respectful and empathic attention. In any exchange, we come to hear our own deeper needs and those of others.

* When we focus on clarifying what is being observed, felt, and needed rather than on diagnosing and judging, we discover the depth of our own compassion. 

* First, we observe what is actually happening in a situation: what are we observing others saying or doing that is either enriching or not enriching our life? The trick is to be able to articulate this observation without introducing any judgment or evaluation—to simply say what people are doing that we either like or don’t like. Next, we state how we feel when we observe this action: are we hurt, scared, joyful, amused, irritated? And thirdly, we say what needs of ours are connected to the feelings we have identified. An awareness of these three components is present when we use NVC to clearly and honestly express how we are.

* Four components of NVC:
    1. observations
    2. feelings
    3. needs
    4. requests

* Thus, part of NVC is to express these four pieces of information very clearly, whether verbally or by other means. The other part of this communication consists of receiving the same four pieces of information from others. We connect with them by first sensing what they are observing, feeling, and needing; then we discover what would enrich their lives by receiving the fourth piece—their request.


* NVC Process
    * The concrete actions we observe that affect our well-being
    * How we feel in relation to what we observe
    * The needs, values, desires, etc. that create our feelings
    * The concrete actions we request in order to enrich our lives



* Two parts of NVC:
    1. expressing honestly through the four components
    2. receiving empathically through the four components

### Chapter 2: Communication That Blocks Compassion

* One kind of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who don’t act in harmony with our values. 

* Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticism, comparisons, and diagnoses are all forms of judgment.

* Our attention is focused on classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather than on what we and others need and are not getting. 

* Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and values.

* Classifying and judging people promotes violence.

* He suggests that if readers have a sincere desire to make life miserable for themselves, they might learn to compare themselves to other people. 

* Comparisons are a form of judgment.

* We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel.

* Communicating our desires as demands is yet another form of language that blocks compassion. A demand explicitly or implicitly threatens listeners with blame or punishment if they fail to comply

* Thinking based on “who deserves what” blocks compassionate communication.

* When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we humans no longer make good slaves and underlings.

### Chapter 3: Observing without Evaluating

* We need to clearly observe what we are seeing, hearing, or touching that is affecting our sense of well-being, without mixing in any evaluation.

* The Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti once remarked that observing without evaluating is the highest form of human intelligence. 

* For most of us, it is difficult to make observations, especially of people and their behavior, that are free of judgment, criticism, or other forms of analysis.

* The first component of NVC entails the separation of observation from evaluation. When we combine observation with evaluation, others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying. 

### Chapter 4: Identifying and Expressing Feelings

* the second component is to express how we are feeling.

* For many of us, however, our feelings are, as May would describe it, “limited like notes in a bugle call.”

* Our repertoire of words for calling people names is often larger than our vocabulary of words to clearly describe our emotional states. 

* This difficulty in identifying and expressing feelings is common, and in my experience, especially so among lawyers, engineers, police officers, corporate managers, and career military personnel—people whose professional codes discourage them from manifesting emotions

* Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.

* Distinguish feelings from thoughts.

* Distinguish between what we feel and what we think we are.

* Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or behave toward us.

* Words such as good and bad prevent the listener from connecting easily with what we might actually be feeling.

### Chapter 5: Taking Responsibility for Our Feelings

* What others do may be the stimulus of our feelings, but not the cause.

* Four options for receiving negative messages:
    1. blame ourselves.
    2. blame others.
    3. sense our own feelings and needs.
    4. sense others’ feelings and needs.

* In NVC, however, we would urge this speaker to go a step further by identifying what she is wanting: what need, desire, expectation, hope, or value of hers has not been fulfilled? As we shall see, the more we are able to connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond compassionately.

* Connect your feeling with your need: “I feel … because I need …”

* Distinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated by guilt.

* Judgments, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations of others are all alienated expressions of our needs. 

* Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs.

* When we express our needs indirectly through the use of evaluations, interpretations, and images, others are likely to hear criticism. And when people hear anything that sounds like criticism, they tend to invest their energy in self-defense or counterattack.

* If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met.

* Stage 1: In this stage, which I refer to as emotional slavery, we believe ourselves responsible for the feelings of others.
    * Emotional slavery. We see ourselves responsible for others' feelings. 
    * Taking responsibility for the feelings of others can be very detrimental to intimate relationships

* Stage 2: The obnoxious stage. We feel angry; we no longer want to be responsible for others’ feelings.

* Stage 3: At the third stage, emotional liberation, we respond to the needs of others out of compassion, never out of fear, guilt, or shame. 
    * Emotional liberation involves stating clearly what we need in a way that communicates we are equally concerned that the needs of others be fulfilled. 
    * Emotional liberation. We take responsibility for our intentions and actions.

### Chapter 6: Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life 

* Use positive language when making requests.

* First of all, we express what we are requesting rather than what we are not requesting. 

* Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want.

* Vague language contributes to internal confusion.

* When we simply express our feelings, it may not be clear to the listener what we want them to do.

* We are often not conscious of what we are requesting.

* Requests may sound like demands when unaccompanied by the speaker’s feelings and needs.

* My belief is that, whenever we say something to another person, we are requesting something in return. It may simply be an empathic connection.

* Or we may be requesting honesty: we wish to know the listener’s honest reaction to our words. Or we may be requesting an action that we hope would fulfill our needs. 

* The clearer we are on what we want back from the other person, the more likely it is that our needs will be met.

* To make sure the message we sent is the message that’s received, ask the listener to reflect it back.

* Express appreciation when your listener tries to meet your request for a reflection.

* We make clear that we’re not testing their listening skills, but checking out whether we’ve expressed ourselves clearly. 

* Empathize with the listener who doesn’t want to reflect back.

* When we address a group without being clear what we are wanting back, unproductive discussions will often follow. 

* For example, when this particular speaker didn’t define what response he wanted, a member of the group might have said, “I’m confused about how you’d like us to respond to your story. Would you be willing to say what response you’d like from us?” Such interventions can prevent the waste of precious group time.

* Our requests are received as demands when others believe they will be blamed or punished if they do not comply. When people hear a demand, they see only two options: submission or rebellion. Either way, the person requesting is perceived as coercive, and the listener’s capacity to respond compassionately to the request is diminished.

* To tell if it’s a demand or a request, observe what the speaker does if the request is not complied with.

* It’s a demand if the speaker then criticizes or judges.

* It’s a demand if the speaker then lays a guilt trip.

* On the other hand, we would know that Jack’s request had been a genuine request, not a demand, if his response to Jane had expressed a respectful recognition of her feelings and needs. For example: “So, Jane, you’re feeling worn out and needing some rest this evening?”
We can help others trust that we are requesting, not demanding, by indicating that we would only want them to comply if they can do so willingly. Thus we might ask, “Would you be willing to set the table?” rather than “I would like you to set the table.” However, the most powerful way to communicate that we are making a genuine request is to empathize with people when they don’t agree to the request.

* It’s a request if the speaker then shows empathy toward the other person’s needs.

* We demonstrate that we are making a request rather than a demand by how we respond when others don’t comply. If we are prepared to show an empathic understanding of what prevents someone from doing as we asked, then by my definition, we have made a request, not a demand. Choosing to request rather than demand does not mean we give up when someone says no to our request. It does mean that we don’t engage in persuasion until we have empathized with what’s preventing the other person from saying yes.

* Expressing genuine requests also requires an awareness of our objective. If our objective is only to change people and their behavior or to get our way, then NVC is not an appropriate tool. The process is designed for those of us who would like others to change and respond, but only if they choose to do so willingly and compassionately. The objective of NVC is to establish a relationship based on honesty and empathy. When others trust that our primary commitment is to the quality of the relationship, and that we expect this process to fulfill everyone’s needs, then they can trust that our requests are true requests and not camouflaged demands.

* Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy.

### Chpater 7: Receiving Emphatically

* Empathy: emptying our mind and listening with our whole being

* Instead of offering empathy, we tend instead to give advice or reassurance and to explain our own position or feeling. Empathy, on the other hand, requires us to focus full attention on the other person’s message. We give to others the time and space they need to express themselves fully and to feel understood. There is a Buddhist saying that aptly describes this ability: “Don’t just do something, stand there.”

* Intellectual understanding blocks empathy.

* Listen to what people are needing rather than what they are thinking.

* When asking for information, first express our own feelings and needs.

* Behind intimidating messages are merely people appealing to us to meet their needs.

* all criticism, attack, insults, and judgments vanish when we focus attention on hearing the feelings and needs behind a message.

* We know a speaker has received adequate empathy when (1) we sense a release of tension, or (2) the flow of words comes to a halt. 

* We need empathy to give empathy. When we sense ourselves being defensive or unable to empathize, we need to (1) stop, breathe, give ourselves empathy; (2) scream nonviolently; or (3) take time out.

#### Chapter 8: The Power of Empathy

* It's harder to empathize with those who appear to possess more power, status, or resources.

* The more we empathize with the other party, the safer we feel.

* Rather than put your "but" in the face of an angry person, empathize.

* What bores the listener bores the speaker too.

* Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend tp listen.

### Chapter 9: Connecting Compassionately with Ourselves

* NVC's most important use may be in developing self-compassion.

* If the way we evaluate ourselves leads us to feel shame, and we consequently change our behavior, we are allowing our growing and learning to be guided by self-hatred. Shame is a form of self-hatred, and actions taken in reaction to shame are not free and joyful acts

* ... should implies that there is no choice. Human beings, when hearing any kind of demand, tend to resist because it threatens our autonomy—our strong need for choice. We have this reaction to tyranny even when it’s internal tyranny in the form of a should

* Self-judgements, like all judgements, are tragic expressions of unmet needs.

* ... an important form of self-compassion is to make choices motivated purely by our desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, duty, or obligation. 

* ... an otherwise joyful activity performed out of obligation, duty, fear, guilt, or shame will lose its joy and eventually engender resistance

* Money is not a “need” as we define it in NVC; it is one of countless strategies that may be selected to address a need

### Chapter 10: Expressing Anger Fully

* We are never angry because of what others say or do.

* The cause of anger lies in our thinking - in thoughts of blame and judgement.

* Anger is a result of life-alienating thinking that is disconnected from needs. It indicates that we have moved up to our head to analyze and judge somebody rather than focus on which of our needs are not getting met.

* Instead of engaging in “righteous indignation,” I recommend connecting empathically with our own needs or those of others.

* ... it’s not what the other person does, but the images and interpretations in my own head that produce my anger.

* We recall four options when hearing a difficult message
    * Blame ourselves
    * Blame others
    * Sense our own feelings and needs
    * Sense others' feelings and needs
    
* Judgements of others contribute to self-fulfilling prophecies.

* The more people hear blame and judgment, the more defensive and aggressive they become and the less they will care about our needs in the future. So even if our present need is met in the sense that people do what we want, we will pay for it later

* Steps to express anger:
    1. Stop. Breathe.
    2. Identify our judgmental thoughts.
    3. Connect with our needs.
    4. Express our feelings and unmet needs.

* Our needs is for the other person to truly hear our pain.

* People do not hear our pain when they believe they are at fault.

* If we wish to fully express anger, the first step is to divorce the other person from any responsibility for our anger. Instead we shine the light of consciousness on our own feelings and needs. By expressing our needs, we are far more likely to get them met than by judging, blaming, or punishing others.

### Chapter 11: The Protective Use of Force

* The intention behind the protective use of force is to prevent injury or injustice, never to punish or to cause individuals to suffer, repent, or change. The punitive use of force tends to generate hostility and to reinforce resistance to the very behavior we are seeking.

### Chapter 12: Liberating Ourselves and Counseling Others

* She was asked to imagine the “career woman” voice taking an “NVC pill” in order to restate its message in the following form: “When a, I feel b, because I am needing c. Therefore I now would like d.”

* The ability to hear our own feelings and needs and empathize with them can free us from depression.

### Chapter 13: Expressing Appreciation in Nonviolent Communication

* Compliments are often judgments - however positive -  of others.

* Express appreciation tp celebrate, not to manipulate.

* Saying "thank you" in NVC: "This is what you did; this is what I feel; this is the need of mine that was met." 

* Receive appreciation without feelings of superiority or false humility.

* ... despite our unease in receiving appreciation, most of us yearn to be genuinely recognized and appreciated.

* Too often I had assumed that others knew the intensity of my appreciation for them, only to discover otherwise. And even when people were embarrassed, they still wanted to hear appreciation verbalized.

### Extras

* ... needs contain no reference to anybody taking any particular action.

* If we really want to be of assistance to others, the first thing to learn is to translate any message into an expression of a need. 

* So this is our work: learning to recognize the need in statements that don’t overtly express any need. 

* It’s important to avoid moving hastily into strategies, as this may result in a compromise that lacks the deep quality of authentic resolution that is possible.

* It is the presentation of strategies in clear, present, positive action language that moves conflicts toward resolution.

* I suggest instead the use of action verbs to capture something that we can see or hear happening—something that can be recorded with a video camera. “Listening” occurs inside a person’s head; another person cannot see whether it is happening or not. 

* When they say “no,” they’re saying they have a need that keeps them from saying “yes” to what we are asking.
