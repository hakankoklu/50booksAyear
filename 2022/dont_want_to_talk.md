## I Don't Want to Talk About It

##### Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male Depression

##### by Terrence Real

### Men's Hidden Depression

* There is a terrible collusion in our society, a cultural cover-up about depression in men. ... We tend not to recognize depression in men because the disorder itself is seen as unmanly. Depression carries, to many, a double stain - the stigma of mental illness and also the stigma of "feminine" emotionality.

* While many men are depressed in ways that are similar to women, there are even more men who express depression in less well-recognized ways, ways that are most often overlooked and misunderstood but nevertheless do great harm.

* Girls are allowed to maintain emotional expressiveness and cultivate connection. But they are systematically discouraged from fully developing and exercising their public, assertive selves - their "voice", as it is often called. Boys, by contrast, are greatly encouraged to develop their public, assertive selves, but they are systematically pushed away from the full exercise of emotional expressiveness and the skills for making and appreciating deep connection.

* Girls, and later women, tend to internalize pain. They blame themselves and draw distress into themselves. Boys, and later men, tend to externalize pain; they are more likely to feel victimized by others and to discharge distress through action.

* Too often, the wounded boy grows up to become a wounding man, inflicting upon those closest to him the very distress he refuses to acknowledge within himself. Depression in men tends to be passed along

* Depressed women have obvious pain; depressed men often have "troubles". It is frequently not they who are in conscious distress so much as the people who live with them.

* This attitude often compounds a depressed man's condition, so that he gets depressed about being depressed. Ashamed about feeling ashamed.

* They found that when female students reached out to their roommates for support about being depressed, they met with nurturing and caring reactions. In contrast, when male students disclosed depression to their roommates, they met with social isolation and often with outright hostility.

### Sons of Narcissus: Self-Esteem, Shame and Depression

* Covert depression is at its core a disorder of self-esteem. Healthy self-esteem is essentially internal. It is the capacity to cherish oneself in the face of one's own imperfections, not because of what one has or what one can do.

* In overt depression, the anguish of shame, of the toxic relationship to the self, is endured. In covert depression, the man desperately defends against such an onslaught. A common defense against the painful experience of deflated value is inflated value; and a common experience for shame, of feeling less than, is a subtle or flagrant flight into grandiosity, of feeling better than.

* The flight from shame to grandiosity lies at the heart of male covert depression.

* In covert depression, the defense or addiction always pulls the man from "less than" to "better than" - rather than to a moderate sense of inherent value. Defensive compensations for underlying depression can never move on directly from shame to healthy self-esteem, because such a shift requires confrontation with, rather than avoidance of, one's own feelings.

### The Hollow Men: Covert Depression and Addiction 

* That is not to say that covertly depressed man are not fully responsible for their offending behaviors. But it is clear that the stable ratio of women in therapy and men in prison has something to teach us about the ways in which each sex is taught by our culture to handle pain.

### A Band Around the Heart: Trauma and Biology

* Beware of 'nice' men with 'bitchy' women.

* Sigmund Freud was the first psychotherapist on record to document patients' reports of childhood trauma and sexual abuse. In one of the most famous mistakes of the twentieth century, Freud decided that his female patients, often daughters of friends and colleagues, were lying. Freud states flatly that his mind would not accept the idea that the decent men he knew could do the things these young women reported. Consequently, he did what most of us have done throughout history when faced with trauma survivors; he disbelieved and blamed them.

* Studies indicate that from the moment of birth, boys are spoken to less than girls, comforted less, nurtured less.

### Perpetrating Masculinity

* The danger lay in Dave's becoming so intent on protecting his son from the kind of abuse from which he suffered that he would end up doing him harm. This is a common dynamic between father and son. And the key to finding the balance between the extremes of neglect or intrusion was to resurface Dave's hidden depression.

* While some theorists may search for the arcane roots of male violence in our hairy ancestors or our DNA, it seems simpler, if more troubling, to confront a more obvious explanation - violence is inculcated in our boys through exposure to violence.

* In a well-known study, two educators placed children of average intelligence with teachers who were told that their new pupils were exceptionally bright. This "pseudo-gifted" group uniformly wound up with better grades and better scholastic performances than a matched group of controls.

* In a classic study, John and Sundry videotaped the reactions of a nine-month-old infant to various stimuli: a teddy bear, a jack-in-the-box, a buzzer, and a doll. They showed it for 204 male and female adults for interpretation. Some were told the baby was male, some female. The adult subjects saw the crying "girl" baby as frightened, but then they thought they were watching a boy, they described "him" as angry.

* Fagot found that parents gave significantly more favorable responses when their children conformed to "same-sex preferred" behavior and actively discouraged "cross-sex preferred" behavior.

* When researchers asked girls and women to define what it means to be feminine, the girls answered with positive language: to be compassionate, to be connected, to care about others. Boys and men, when asked to describe masculinity, predominantly responded with double negatives. Boys and men did not talk about being strong so much as about not being weak. They do not list independence so much as not being dependent. They did not speak about being close to their fathers so much as about pulling away from their mothers. In short, being a man generally means not being a woman.

* The myth I speak of is the idea that boys must be turned into men to begin with, that boys, unlike girls, must achieve masculinity. Boys must repudiate their connection to mother and to all things feminine.

* Confusion about what "maleness" means can result in severe psychological difficulties and "antisocial" behaviors. ... Rigid notions about masculinity, far from being a necessary component of good psychological adjustment, may be a negative factor.

* Boys do not need to be turned into males. They are males. Boys do not need to develop their masculinity. They are masculine, no less than girls are feminine.

* The sons have learned not to expect their father to attend to them or to be expressive about much of anything. They have come to expect him to be psychologically unavailable. They have also learned that he is not accountable in this emotional absence, that Mother does not have the power either to engage him or to confront him.

### The Loss of the Relational

* For many decades, in both our popular imagination and in psychological theory, helping the boy sever his "psychological umbilical cord" was viewed as one of the father's main functions.

* The typical American father spends on average eleven minutes a day with his children. And most of that time is spent in play.

* These boys suffer less from their relationship to the absent fathers than they suffer from their relationship to the overwhelmed mothers they must live with, mothers they have bullied into silence, much to their own detriment.

* Recent research indicates that in this society most males have difficulty not just expressing, but even in identifying their feelings.

* The cultivation of a stance of invulnerability robs men of a wisdom known to most women in this culture - that people actually connect better when they expose their weakness.

* A man cannot recover from either overt or covert depression and remain emotionally numb at the same time; he cannot be related and walled off simultaneously; he cannot be intimate with others before establishing intimate terms with his own heart.

### Collateral Damage

* When we reinforce a boy's grandiosity, we invite him to escape such pain by flights into addiction or the illusion of dominance.

* Traditionally, girls and women are encouraged to maintain connection - to the emotional parts of themselves and to others. But in order to preserve their attachments, girls must learn to silence and subjugate themselves. ... Girls speak less in mixed groups than in all-girls settings. They interrupt less, apologize more, and use more disclaimers when they talk.

* Boys' initiation rites, by contrast, are not about captivity. They are about pain and the boy's capacity to endure it. ... Boys' initiations culminate the toughening process that begins early in childhood. They frequently mock and shame the boy. The ritual wounds are often physical, sometimes sexual.

* The theme of the powerful disconnected make proving his worth through the violent rescue of the dependent female is a drama endlessly replayed in our culture.

* Disempowering abuse shames the child setting the stage for victimization later in life. False empowerment instills grandiosity in the child and sets the adult up to become offensive.

* This sudden switch from "one down" to "one up" and back again leaves boys and men in a perpetual state of anxiety about their status.

* Once we realize that the elusive "masculine identity" does not exist inside the boy's psyche, but rather that it is a social construct to which the boy must bend and comply, we can understand why it is impossible for most boys to feel secure about it.

* Oppressed women sometimes find it difficult to grasp why privileged men feel so pressured. But boys and men live each day with a kind of fear that can only rarely be assuaged.

* Healthy self-esteem is an inherent, nonfluctuating sense of oneself as essentially worthwhile. Shame states, or failures in self-esteem, are experienced as a sense of not being enough and not mattering, as emptiness, fear, or impotence. ... since masculinity is conferred more than won, since it represents membership, not a state of being, it is always in danger of being revoked.

* Research indicates that when men are placed in empathy-demanding situations, as single, custodial parents or caretakers of the ill or the elderly, they are readily capable of becoming just as nurturant and empathic as female counterparts.

### Two Inner Children

* Overt depression is violence endured. Covert depression is violence deflected.

* Depression is an obsessive disorder. A depressed person is endlessly caught in the chains of his rehearsed inadequacies.

* When our culture teaches boys to repudiate the "feminine" in themselves, to hold that part of themselves in contempt, we teach them to split themselves in half. ... The dialogue between those two internalized roles becomes the inner discourse we call depression.

* Boys do not internalize either masculinity or femininity. Instead, they internalize a pattern in which women and womanish things - including half of the boy's own being - are held inferior.

### Balance Prevails: Healing the Legacy

* "Do the work," I will often say to such a man. "Face the pain, now, or pass it on to your children, just as it was passed on to you."

### Crossing the Wasteland: Healing Ourselves

* Once a man resolves to take up his hero's journey, real therapy can begin. Our descent occurs in three phases. First, the addictive defenses must stop. Then, the dysfunctional patterns in the man's relation to himself must be attended to. Finally, buried early trauma must reemerge and, as much as possible, be released.

* When a man relies on the defenses employed in covert depression, he places himself in the hazardous position of trying to ameliorate the pain of alienation in ways that leave him more alienated than he was at the start.

* What I call addiction and what psychoanalytically oriented therapists would call a "self disorder" or a "narcissistic dependency" are synonymous.

* When a man with covert depression uses something we normally think of as benign, or even as positive, like work or exercise, it seems almost laughable to insist on questioning the function of that activity in his life. But ordinary activities used as a defense against depression can have wide-ranging consequences.

* The degree to which a man relies upon addictive defenses to ward off depression determines the degree of his abusiveness or irresponsibility toward others. A covertly depressed man cannot afford to fully be responsive to those around him because his primary need lies in maintaining his defense, his emotional "prosthesis." It is not uncommon for a man's need for performance-based esteem to become so compulsive that it not only gets in the way of his relationships, it even gets in the way of his performance.

* Khantzian's research on both alcoholics and drug abusers led him to focus on four cardinal areas of dysregulation: difficulty in maintaining healthy self-esteem; difficulty in regulating one's feelings; difficulty in exercising self-care; and difficulty in sustaining connection to others.

* Traditional socialization of boys diminishes the capacity to esteem the self without going up into grandiosity or down into shame. Traditional masculinization teaches boys to replace inherent self-worth with performance-based esteem.

* I do not see relational skills as static entities toward which one has a passive, helpless relationship. They are activities. Self-esteem, for example, is not something one has; it is something one does. And it is something one can learn to do better. I call this part of recovery work the practice of relational maturity.

* Men like Jeffrey learn the internal technology of first recognizing and then bringing themselves up from the shame states; of recognizing and then bringing themselves down from grandiose states. The depressed man's relationship to self-esteem becomes proactive, as does his relationship to boundaries, getting in touch with his feelings, dependency, and moderation.

* Depression is not really a feeling; it is a condition of numbness, of nonfeeling. In my work with depressed men, I differentiate between states and feelings. States are global, diffuse, impersonal. One's relationship to a state is passive, disembodied.

* The cure for states is feelings. Unlike states, feelings will run their own course in due time. Despite the often expressed male fear that, if one were to let oneself cry, one would never stop, tears eventually taper off if one lets them. Feelings are not endless, but our numbing attempts to avoid them can last a lifetime.

* Recovery from covert depression must involve three layers - the addictive defense; the underlying relational immaturity or disorder of self; and the childhood trauma that set the whole process in motion.

### Learning Intimacy: Healing Our Relationships 

* The same gender bifurcation that deprives men of their hearts deprives women of their voices, setting up a culturally sanctioned pas de deux in which the man's covert depression, his dependency on self-esteem props, is matched by his spouse's protectiveness, her often resentful dependency to him.

* A great many men have been falsely empowered by this culture's belief that discipline is not required in their domestic lives - relationships need not be actively worked on. "A man is the king of his castle," the old saying goes. And, while few modern men would have the temerity to state such a belief openly, a great many act on it.

* As psychiatrist Matt Dumont has written: "It does not matter much whether the returning male is a miner or a professor; his wife, knowingly or not, has the culturally defined task of reading his face for signs of despair and doing her level best to get him back out there again the next day. Women are the cheerleaders of industrial society."

* Society teaches neither member of the couple how to deal with the raw pain that is part of any real relationship, because it does not even acknowledge the existence of that pain.

* Yes, there are structural differences between men and women, but the real picture is by no means as simple as one might think. There is some indication, that human males are, if anything, more emotional to exhibit greater separation distress when they are left by their mothers, to be more excitable, more easily disturbed, and harder to comfort.

* Any woman knows that few strategies serve to "build up" a male more effectively than her own appearance of helplessness. Some women seem willing to keep their covertly depressed men strong by becoming less functional than their partners. Such self-sacrifice does not belong simply to a lunatic fringe. Married women are consistently reported on a number of sociological measures as less happy, less well adjusted, more anxious, more overtly depressed, and generally more neurotic than either married men or single women, while single men are the most at-risk population in the nation for both physical and psychological health problems.

* Like many children from chaotic homes, even though my father was the flagrant abuser, my most unresolved feelings are reserved for the parent who refused to protect me. While I know intellectually that my feelings toward her might be unfair, they nevertheless remain less forgiving than those toward my dad.

* When I am faced with a family in which there is a depressed woman, my first move is to empower the woman. When I am faced with a family in which there is a depressed man, before beginning work with the man, my first move is to empower the woman. To help a depressed woman means facilitating her rise against the forces of oppression that surround her. To help a depressed man, one needs to invite him to step up to increased relational responsibility, a move he may not be inclined to make if his partner allows him to avoid it.

* In overt depression, the man may express "feminine" vulnerabilities but, couple them with a "masculine" entitlement to behave irresponsibly.

* Work with depressed men and their partners has convinced me that men's much-vaunted fear of women and of intimacy is really not a fear of either. What men fear is subjugation. In the on up/on down, better than/less than, hierarchical world of traditional masculinity, one is either in control or controlled.

### Conclusion: Where We Stand

* The essential shift in question that marks a depressed man's transformation is the shift from: What will I get? to: What can I offer? Entering into a fathering relationship -  to a child, a mate, an art, a cause, to the planet - means to become a true provider. Recovery demands a move into generativity.

* When the critical questions concern what one is going to get, a man is living in a boy's world. Beyond a certain point in a man's life, if he is to remain truly vital, he needs to be actively engaged in devotion to something other than his own success and happiness.

* Studies indicate that while fathering may or may not be necessary for the psychological adjustment for boys, it is highly advantageous for the psychological adjustment of the father.
