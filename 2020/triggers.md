## Triggers

##### Creating behavior that lasts - Becoming the person that you want to be

##### by Marshall Goldsmith

### Intro

* A trigger is any stimulus that reshapes our thoughts and actions.

### Chapter 1

* Meaningful behavioral change is very hard to do.
* Given the choice we prefer to do nothing.
* No one can make us change unless we truly want to change.

### Chapter 2

* Belief triggers are rationalizations that we use to justify our inaction.
  * If I understand, I will do.
  * I have willpower and won't give in to temptation.
  * Today is a special day.
  * "At least I'm better than ..."
  * I should not need help or structure.
  * I won't get tired and my enthusiasm won't fade.
  * I have all the time in the world.
  * I won't get distracted and nothing unexpected will occur.
  * An epiphany will suddenly change my life.
  * My change will be permanent and I will never have to worry again.
  * My elimination of all problems will not bring on new problems.
  * My efforts will be fairly rewarded.
    * Getting better is its own reward, external rewards don't work.
  * No one is paying attention to me.
  * If I change, I am "inauthentic".
  * I have the wisdom to assess my own behavior.

### Chapter 3

* Even when we are aware of our environment and welcome being in it, we become victims of its ruthless power.
* Our environment is at war with us, trying to control us, taxing and draining us. Like entropy we have to constantly spend energy to keep it at bay.
* Our environment is constantly changing and in turn changing us.

### Chapter 4

* Sometimes, feedback itself is the trigger.
* Feedback loop: evidence, relevance, consequence, action
* A behavioral trigger is any stimulus that impacts our behavior.
  * It can be direct or indirect.
  * It can be internal or external.
  * It can be conscious or unconscious.
  * It can be anticipated or unexpected.
  * It can be encouraging or discouraging.
  * It can be productive or counterproductive.
* There is a tension between what we want and what we need. When they align, it is great but it rarely happens.

### Chapter 5

* Cue-reward, stimulus-response models for habit modification don't work well for interpersonal routines.
* There is a short time between trigger and behavior where impulse -> awareness -> choice happens.
* We are more alert for the impulse-awareness-choice pattern in high stakes situations, we let go in more mundane situations.

### Chapter 6

* Situational leadership
  * Directing
  * Coaching
  * Supporting
  * Delegating
* We have a planned and a doer inside us. Planner assumes the doer will do as planned.But it needs to be managed based on above principles.

### Chapter 7

* To limit environment's effect on us, we need to master anticipation, avoidancean and adjustment.
* It is easier to anticipate things around big events. We fail when we think stakes are low.
* If we anticipate that an environment will trigger us in a bad way, we need to avoid it. Resist the temptation to take it on.
* If you can't avoid, you need to adjust your behavior to not give in to the triggers of the environment.

### Chapter 8

* The environment is out in the open giving constant feedback. However, it's hard to stay alert as we move from one environment to another.
* The wheel of change
  * Create the positive elements that we want to create
  * Preserve the positive elements that we want to preserve
  * Eliminate the negative elements that we want to eliminate
  * Accept the negative elments that we accept to keep
* The wheel of change doesn't make things magically happen but it simplifies what to focus on.

### Chapter 9

* Apologizing, asking for help, optimism are magic moves because they trigger decent behavior in others
* Fourth one is asking active questions.
* Don't ask "have I changed", "was I better today", etc. Ask "did I do my best to achieve change", "to be better", etc.

### Chapter 10

* Top six engaging questions for everyone:
  * Did I do my best to set clear goals?
  * Did I do my best to make progress towards my goals?
  * Did I do my best to find meaning?
  * Did I do my best to be happy?
  * Did I do my best to build positive relationships?
  * Did I do my best to be fully engaged?
* Find other questions that reflects your objectives to be the person you want to be and add it to your daily questions.
* Answering daily questions is hard, especially rating your effort. Half the people stop answering after two weeks.

### Chapter 11

* Daily questions
  * reinforce our commitment.
  * ignite our motivation where we need it.
  * highlight the difference between self-discipline and self-control.
    * achieving desirable behavior vs avoiding undesirable behavior
  * shrink our goals to manageable increments.
* Daily questions remind us that
  * change doesn't happen overnight.
  * success is the sum of small consistent efforts.

### Chapter 12

* Benefits of daily questions
  * If we do it, we get better.
  * We get better faster.
  * We become our own coach eventually.

### Chapter 13

* Think about if a battle is worth fighting for, if it makes sense to spend energy and effort
* Otherwise, let it go, don't correct people, resent others' and your decisions, voice your opinion if you are not willing to face the consequences.

### Chapter 14 - 15

* Change needs structure. Not every structure fits every case but we need to come up with a structure and stick to it.

### Chapter 16

* Depletion cripples our willpower and self-control. Don't do anything important when depleted.
* Structure prevents depletion and doing unwanted things when depleted.

### Chapter 17

* Assume you will be asked "did I do my best" questions when you are stuck in a meeting, etc.

### Chapter 18
