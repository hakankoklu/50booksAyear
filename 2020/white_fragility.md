## White Fragility

##### Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism

##### by Robin DiAngelo

### Introduction: We can't get there from here

* I could see the power of the belief that only bad people were racist, as well as how individualism allowed white people to exempt themselves from the forces of socialization. ... I also saw how hard we worked to deny all this and how defensive we became when these dynamics were named.

* I believe that white progressives cause the most daily damage to people of color. ... White progressives can be the most difficult for people of color because, to the degree that we think we have arrived, we will put our energy into making sure that others see us as having arrived.

### Chapter 1: The challenges of talking to white people about racism

* Yet our simplistic definition of racism — as intentional acts of racial discrimination committed by immoral individuals — engenders a confidence that we are not part of the problem and that our learning is thus complete.

* ... reflecting on our racial frames is particularly challenging for many white people, because we are taught that to have a racial viewpoint is to be biased. Unfortunately, this belief protects our biases, because denying that we have them ensures that we won't examine or change them.

### Chapter 2: Racism and white supremacy

* Under the skin, there is no true biological race. The external characteristics that we use to define race are unreliable indicators of genetic variation between any two people.

* Jefferson suggested that there were natural differences between the races and asked scientists to find them.

* Exploitation came first, and then the ideology of unequal races to justify this exploitation followed. 

* To justify these contradictory rulings, the court stated that being white was based on the common understanding of the white man. In other words, people already seen as white got to decide who was white.

* If poor whites were focused on feeling superior to those below them in status, they were less focused on those above. The poor and working classes, if united across race, could be a powerful force. But racial divisions have served to keep them from organizing against the owning class who profits from their labor.

* When a racial group’s collective prejudice is backed by the power of legal authority and institutional control, it is transformed into racism, a far-reaching system that functions independently from the intentions or self-images of individual actors.

* Racism differs from individual racial prejudice and racial discrimination in the historical accumulation and ongoing use of institutional power and authority to support the prejudice and to systematically enforce discriminatory behaviors with far-reaching effects.

* When I say that only whites can be racist, I mean that in the United States, only whites have the collective social and institutional power and privilege over people of color. People of color do not have this power and privilege over white people.

* Imagine if instead, the story went something like this: “Jackie Robinson, the first black man whites allowed to play major-league baseball.”

* White supremacy describes the culture we live in, a culture that positions white people and all that is associated with them (whiteness) as ideal. White supremacy is more than the idea that whites are superior to people of color; it is the deeper premise that supports this idea — the definition of whites as the norm or standard for human, and people of color as a deviation from that norm.

### Chapter 3: Racism after the civil rights movement 

* This is a classic example of aversive racism: holding deep racial disdain that surfaces in daily discourse but not being able to admit it because the disdain conflicts with our self-image and professed beliefs.

* Unfortunately, aversive racism only protects racism, because we can’t challenge our racial filters if we can’t consider the possibility that we have them. Of course, some whites explicitly avow racism. We might consider these whites actually more aware of, and honest about, their biases than those of us who consider ourselves open-minded yet who have rarely thought critically about the biases we inevitably hold or how we may be expressing them.

### Chapter 4: How does race shape the lives of white people?

* ... when we are not looking for the black or Asian perspective, we return to white writers, reinforcing the idea of whites as just human, and people of color as particular kinds (racialized) of humans. This also allows white (male) writers to be seen as not having an agenda or any particular perspective, while racialized (and gendered) writers do.

* The most profound message of racial segregation may be that the absence of people of color from our lives is no real loss.

### Chapter 5: The good/bad binary

* Within this paradigm, to suggest that I am racist is to deliver a deep moral blow — a kind of character assassination. Having received this blow, I must defend my character, and that is where all my energy will go — to deflecting the charge, rather than reflecting on my behavior.

* As African American scholar and filmmaker Omowale Akintunde says: “Racism is a systemic, societal, institutional, omnipresent, and epistemologically embedded phenomenon that pervades every vestige of our reality. For most whites, however, racism is like murder: the concept exists, but someone has to commit it in order for it to happen. This limited view of such a multilayered syndrome cultivates the sinister nature of racism and, in fact, perpetuates racist phenomena rather than eradicates them.”

* The good/bad frame is a false dichotomy. All people hold prejudices, especially across racial lines in a society deeply divided by race. I can be told that everyone is equal by my parents, I can have friends of color, and I may not tell racist jokes. Yet I am still affected by the forces of racism as a member of a society in which racism is the bedrock. I will still be seen as white, treated as white, and experience life as a white person. My identity, personality, interests, and investments will develop from a white perspective. I will have a white worldview and a white frame of reference. In a society in which race clearly matters, our race profoundly shapes us. If as a white person, I conceptualize racism as a binary and I place myself on the “not racist” side, what further action is required of me? No action is required, because I am not a racist. Therefore, racism is not my problem; it doesn’t concern me and there is nothing further I need to do. 

* A racism-free upbringing is not possible, because racism is a social system embedded in the culture and its institutions. We are born into this system and have no say in whether we will be affected by it.

### Chapter 9: White fragility in action

* FUNCTIONS OF WHITE FRAGILITY
    * Maintain white solidarity
    * Close off self-reflection
    * Trivialize the reality of racism
    * Silence the discussion
    * Make white people the victims
    * Hijack the conversation
    * Protect a limited worldview
    * Take race off the table
    * Protect white privilege
    * Focus on the messenger, not the message
    * Rally more resources to white people
    
### Chapter 10: White fragility and the rules of engagement

* White fragility punishes the person giving feedback and presses them back into silence. It also maintains white solidarity — the tacit agreement that we will protect white privilege and not hold each other accountable for our racism. 

* I try to follow these guidelines:
    * How, where, and when you give me feedback is irrelevant — it is the feedback I want and need. Understanding that it is hard to give, I will take it any way I can get it. From my position of social, cultural, and institutional white power and privilege, I am perfectly safe and I can handle it. If I cannot handle it, it’s on me to build my racial stamina.
    * Thank you.

* ... stopping our racist patterns must be more important than working to convince others that we don’t have them. We do have them, and people of color already know we have them; our efforts to prove otherwise are not convincing.

### Chapter 11: White women's tears

* For example, there is a long historical backdrop of black men being tortured and murdered because of a white woman’s distress, and we white women bring these histories with us. Our tears trigger the terrorism of this history, particularly for African Americans. 

* The murder of Emmett Till is just one example of the history that informs an oft-repeated warning from my African American colleagues: “When a white woman cries, a black man gets hurt.” Not knowing or being sensitive to this history is another example of white centrality, individualism, and lack of racial humility.

* Whether intended or not, when a white woman cries over some aspect of racism, all the attention immediately goes to her, demanding time, energy, and attention from everyone in the room when they should be focused on ameliorating racism. While she is given attention, the people of color are yet again abandoned and/or blamed.

* In a common but particularly subversive move, racism becomes about white distress, white suffering, and white victimization.

* Tears that are driven by white guilt are self-indulgent. When we are mired in guilt, we are narcissistic and ineffective; guilt functions as an excuse for inaction.

### Chapter 12: Where do we go from here?

* Claims that suggest openness and humility:
    * I appreciate this feedback.
    * This is very helpful.
    * It’s my responsibility to resist defensiveness and complacency.
    * This is hard, but also stimulating and important.
    * Oops!
    * It is inevitable that I have this pattern. I want to change it.
    * It’s personal but not strictly personal.
    * I will focus on the message and not the messenger.
    * I need to build my capacity to endure discomfort and bear witness to the pain of racism.
    * I have some work to do.

* Assumptions:
    * Being good or bad is not relevant.
    * Racism is a multilayered system embedded in our culture.
    * All of us are socialized into the system of racism.
    * Racism cannot be avoided.
    * Whites have blind spots on racism, and I have blind spots on racism.
    * Racism is complex, and I don’t have to understand every nuance of the feedback to validate that feedback.
    * Whites are / I am unconsciously invested in racism.
    * Bias is implicit and unconscious; I don’t expect to be aware of mine without a lot of ongoing effort.
    * Giving us white people feedback on our racism is risky for people of color, so we can consider the feedback a sign of trust.
    * Feedback on white racism is difficult to give; how I am given the feedback is not as relevant as the feedback itself.
    * Authentic antiracism is rarely comfortable. Discomfort is key to my growth and thus desirable.
    * White comfort maintains the racial status quo, so discomfort is necessary and important.
    * I must not confuse comfort with safety; as a white person, I am safe in discussions of racism.
    * The antidote to guilt is action.
    * It takes courage to break with white solidarity; how can I support those who do?
    * I bring my group’s history with me; history matters.
    * Given my socialization, it is much more likely that I am the one who doesn’t understand the issue.
    * Nothing exempts me from the forces of racism.
    * My analysis must be intersectional (a recognition that my other social identities—class, gender, ability—inform how I was socialized into the racial system).
    * Racism hurts (even kills) people of color 24-7. Interrupting it is more important than my feelings, ego, or self-image.

* I believe that if we white people were truly coming from these assumptions, not only would our interpersonal relationships change, but so would our institutions.
