##### How to learn any language fast and never forget it

##### by Gabriel Wyner

* Three keys to language learning:
  * Learn pronunciation first
  * Don't translate
  * Use spaced repetition systems -> SRS
* To maximize efficiency, spend your time recalling rather than reviewing.
* Go check the sounds of the language at wikipedia and learn them, find out about the sounds that you don't have in your native language.
* Use SRS for everything, words, grammar rules, phonemes, pronunciation, etc.
* Use a word frequency list for your language.
* Make your own flash cards, either physical ones or on an app but spend time making them as the experience of making them helps to remember.
* Flash cards
* Use what you learn to build stories to make them memorable to you.
* Use the online resources, there are many communities where you can find people to correct your writing. Do the same for others who are learning your language.
* If you are in a country where your money is more valuable compared to others, find tutors from the country of the language you are learning online.
* Use Google Images to find the meaning of words, to understand the nuances, to find good examples of the words being used in a sentence.
* Find an interesting foreign TV show or dubbed American TV series without subtitles. You can read the plot summary beforehand to be able follow if it gets too hard.
