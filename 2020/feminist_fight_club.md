## Feminist Fight Club

##### An office survival manual for a sexist workplace

##### by Jessica Bennett

* Stay calm (I know easier said than done)
* Collect facts
* Speak up
* Act confident
* Ask for what you want
* Help other women
* Say no
* Brag away
* Find a wingwoman/ally
* Claim credit
* Set boundaries to avoid burnout
* Do not overapologize
* Don't take it personal, ask again and again when rejected
