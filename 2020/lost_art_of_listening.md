## The Lost Art of Listening

##### How Learning to Listen Can Improve Relationships

##### by Michael P. Nichols

### Intro

* To listen well, we must forget ourselves and submit to the other person's need for attention.
* We tend to react to what is being said, rather than concentrating on what the other person is trying to express.
* The book consists of 4 parts:
  * Why listening is important
  * Why we don't listen
  * How to control reactivity and be better at listening
  * How listening is different in different relationships

### Part 1: The yearning to be understood

### Chapter 1: Why listening is so important

* Empathy can be achieved by suspending our preoccupation with ourselves.
* Most of us think of ourselves as better listeners than we are.
* It hurts to not be listened to, especially by people that are special and important to us.
* Empathic listening takes in the words and gets to what's behind them.
* Being listened to nourishes our sense of worth.
* A good listener is a witness, not a judge.
* Reassuring is not the same as listening.
* Being heard confirms our common humanity.

### Chapter 2: How listening shapes us and connects us to each other

* Being listened to shapes us; not being listened to twists us.
* A child whose communications aren't appreciated eventually gives up and turns inward with disengagement, distance and avoidance in interactions.
* The feeling of not being understood is one of the most painful human experiences.

### Chapter 3: How communication breaks down

* We become more interesting when we assume interest on the part of our listeners.
* To listen well, it is necessary to let go of what's on our mind.
* A speaker's reticence is often due to habits based on expectations formed from past. They don't expect people to listen.

### Part 2: The real reasons people don't listen

### Chapter 4: The heart of listening: The struggle to suspend our own needs

* Genuine listening demands taking on interest in the speaker and suspending the interests of the self, memory, desire and judgement.
* To listen well, we have to read the needs of the speaker and respond to the context.
* Don'ts:
  * that reminds me of the time ...
  * oh, how awful! -> excessive sympathy makes it about you
  * well, if I were you ... -> unwanted advice
  * don't feel that way -> dismissive
  * haven't we talked about this before -> dismissive, get over it attitude
  * guess what?! -> what I have to say is more important
  * be self-conscious about how you are doing as a listener, you need let go
  * be an amateur therapist
  * be too active as a listener -> distracting, makes it about you
  * have you heard about the one about ... -> jokester, feels the need to make light of everything, probably has anxiety

### Chapter 5: How hidden assumptions prejudice listening

* Identify the different defensive parts of you and the others when commnication breaks down
* How parents made you feel unlistened to affects your listening.

### Chapter 6: How emotionality makes us defensive

* What we can't tolerate in others is often what we can't tolerate on ourselves.
* Reacting emotionally is the number one reason of arguments.
* The ability to listen comes from our resistance to react emotionally.
* Check your reactivity and focus on other person's side, repeat their point and ask for clarification. Respond after that or much later to avoid emotional reactivity.
* Saying "I don't understant" instead of "I understand" is often more useful because it might open the other person up.

### Part 3: Getting through to each other

### Chapter 7: How to let go of your own needs and listen

* Practice listening with the sole intention of understanding, stop everything else.
* Better listening comes from a sincere effort to pay attention and ends with specific queries to open the other person up.
* Ask questions that invites elaboration.
* Put yourself in the other person's shoes
* Relinquish control, acknowledge the other person's feelings.

### Chapter 8: Empathy begins with openness

* Empathy requires receptive openness and a balance between feeling and thinking.
* Learn the other's expectations. To some people loud, overlapping talk is a sign of enthusiasm, to others it is rude and a sign of not listening.

### Chapter 9: How to defuse emotional reactivity

* When you get a reactive response, don't get defensive, acknowledge the other person's feelings and try to understand what they are going through.
* Preparing for tense encounters will prevent overreacting.
* When someone is complaining, don't immediately defend or respond; sometimes all they need is being listened to.

### Part 4: Listening in context

### Chapter 10: Listening between intimate partners

* Couples who learn to listen to each other often find that they don't need to change each other, marriage is about learning to live with the differences.
* It takes two to tango, when you have a complaint, think about what the other half of the pattern could be and your contribution to the pattern.
* When someone is perceived to be nagging, it means they haven't been listened to, not being listened to makes people resentful.
* Those who feel nagged usually don't listen because they don't want to hear blame or requests that don't seem to be open to discussion.
* When complaining:
  * emphasize your feelings, not their shortcomings.
  * describe how the situation is affecting you without being accusatory.
  * give the other person a turn, don't get reactive if they get defensive.
* If you are going to counter to a complaint, make sure to acknowledge the other person's point.
* Don't judge your partner by measuring them against your strengths, measure them against their strengths.
